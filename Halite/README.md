# halite-convnet
Final rank of 70 (Gold) with a convolutional neural net trained on ~4.5m examples

train_bot.py implements a simple ConvNet architecture (requires keras and tensorflow/theano) trained on high-level replays (not included due to file size limit)

networking.py and hlt.py are used to interact with halite.exe, which is the game world

MyBot.py and model.h5 allows for testing of model in the simulated game world
